# Explain Selection statements and Sequential Statements?
# selection statements are used to make decisions based on conditions.
# Types of selection statements most commonly used are if, elif, else
#  example:--
# if condition
# x = 10
# if x > 5:
#     print("x is greater than 5")
    # here if condition checks the condition x>5 is true then it will print x is greater than 5
    
    # if-else-if condition
# x = 40
# if x > 30:
#     print("x is greater than 30")
# elif x == 20:
#     print("x is equal to 20")
# else:
#     print("x is less than 20")
    # here the program checks condition acording to value of x
    
    
    
    # sequential statements-- are performed in sequential order without controlling their executiom
    # example:--
    
    #  a = 5
    #  b = 10 
    # c= a+b
    #   print("The sum of a and b is:", c) = 15
    # in this example the sum of a and b are executed in sequential order without controlling the flow execution
