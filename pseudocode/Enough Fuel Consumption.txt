start:

      required =  fuel * distance

1. Read input values for fuel and distance.
2. Calculate the required fuel: required = fuel \times distance
3. If required > 50:
     - Print "Enough" (you have enough fuel)
   Else:
     - Print "Go On" (continue the journey)

=> For the given sample input:

Fuel = 1
Distance = 46
Calculating the required fuel:
   required = 1 * 46 = 46

Since the required fuel (46) is less than 50, the output should be “Go On.”
