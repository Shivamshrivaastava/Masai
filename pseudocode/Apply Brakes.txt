1. Read input values for distance and time.
2. Calculate the speed: speed = distance / time
3. If speed > 40:
     - Print "Apply Brake"
   Else:
     - Print "Keep Going"

For the given sample input:

Distance = 100
Time = 2

Calculating the speed:
Speed = 100/2 ​= 50
Since the speed (50) is greater than 40, the output should be “Apply Brake.”
Therefore, the output is:
Apply Brake.
